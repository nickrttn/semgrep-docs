# December 2023 release notes

## 🔧 OSS Engine

* The following versions of the OSS Engine were released in September 2023:

## 🌐 Cloud Platform

### Fixed

* Improved the speed with which Semgrep Cloud Platform's Dashboard loads.
* Disabled the **Add to Policy** button when writing validator rules using
  Semgrep Cloud Platform's rules editor. <!--SCRT-292-->
* Fixed issue where webhooks stopped working.
* Fixed issue where the rule information card and the rule preview are missing
  for older findings; all findings now display this information.
  <!--FIND-1433-->
* Fixed issue so that clicking **Start Tour** now restarts the Getting Started
  tutorial.
* Fixed issue where the **Members** page doesn't display a user's new role until the
  page reloads. <!--OS-1233-->
* Fixed issue where the finding's severity displayed doesn't match the rule's severity
  once the rule has been updated. <!--FIND-1397-->
* Fixed issue where users switching organizations would result in a 404. <!--OS-136-->
* Fixed the **Connect to** button under **Settings** > **Source Code Managers**
  so that it displays correctly based on whether the user can connect to a source
  code manager. <!-- https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep-app/pull/11812 -->

## 💻 Code

## ⛓️ Supply Chain

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where findings marked as **fixed** can be triaged via the rule
  group. If the first finding in the list of findings is fixed, then the rest are also fixed; as such, the rule checkboxes are now disabled.
  <!--FIND-1453-->

## 🤖 Assistant (beta)

## 🔐 Secrets (beta)

### Added

* Added support for custom validator rules. Note that custom validator rules are
  private and can't be shared to Semgrep Registry.

### Fixed

* Fixed issue where the **Ignore** button doesn't work when triaging Secrets.
